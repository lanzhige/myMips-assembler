# myMips-assembler
A assembler to assemble self designed MIPS like instruction set

This is an assembler of MIPS-like assembly language.
The instruction set is designed imitating MIPS assembly language (a RISC instruction set).
The instruction set is designed to be an equal length of 32 bits.
It contains R, I, J three types of intructions.
For detailed introduction of the language, please check the document of intruction.pdf

The codes are tested and generated in VS2013 windows x64 environment.
Test inputs are stored in the ./test/ directory
Assembly codes are stored in the ./mips/ directory
